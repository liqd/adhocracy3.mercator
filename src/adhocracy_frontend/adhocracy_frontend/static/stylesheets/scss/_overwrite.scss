 * When adhocracy is embedded, we have some code that determines its height and
 * resizes the iframe accordingly.  For this to work, the body must not have
 * any margins.  Apart from setting `margin: 0` on body we also need to prevent
 * margin collapsing.  This can be done by adding a small padding both at the
 * top and the bottom.  The trade-off is that there is some additional padding
 * which might look strange.
